# USB-C Battery Module

A compact and reliable power module for battery-powered electronics.

## Introduction

This module is designed to be used in guitars and effect pedals as a rechargeable supply with minimal output voltage ripple.

The module contains a TP4056 charging IC and a voltage regulation stage consisting of a TLV61048 boost converter and a TLV76701 linear regulator for further smoothing of the output voltage.

It is designed for 9V output voltage, although it can be configured by adjusting a couple of resistor dividers. It also has PH connectors for charging, battery and output to be able to adapt it to different use cases.
